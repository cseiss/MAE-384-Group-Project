Final project for MAE384

For part one, through the use of ODE equations and parameters given in the form of recovery and infection rates we are able to predict how disease will spread, and how fast people will recover. The ODE solver essentially simulates diseases, which are given in the form of differential equations, and how fast the population will recover with the paramter values.
